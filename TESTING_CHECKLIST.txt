[ ] Negative values in any numeric field show error
[ ] Future date selection shows error
[ ] Missing weather selection shows error
[ ] All validation errors display clearly in red

SECTION 5: SUMMARY SECTION
===========================

[ ] "Activities with Progress" counts only activities with achieved > 0
[ ] "Total Target" sums all target values correctly
[ ] "Total Achieved" sums all achieved values correctly
[ ] Progress bar displays when Total Target > 0
[ ] Progress percentage calculates correctly: (Total Achieved / Total Target) * 100
[ ] Progress bar caps at 100% even if achieved exceeds target

[ ] Activities with data (target/achieved/cumulative > 0) saved to report_activities table
[ ] Activities with all zeros are NOT saved to database
[ ] Each activity record includes: activity_name, unit, target, achieved, cumulative, remarks
[ ] Updating existing report preserves report_id
[ ] Old activities are deleted and replaced on update
[ ] Database timestamps (created_at, updated_at) are set correctly

SECTION 8: ERROR HANDLING
==========================

[ ] Database connection failure shows appropriate error
[ ] Network errors during save display user-friendly message
[ ] Invalid data types are caught before submission
[ ] Form doesn't crash on unexpected input

[ ] No lag when switching between fields
[ ] Summary updates in real-time as user enters data
[ ] Form works on mobile devices (test on phone/tablet)
[ ] All text is readable on small screens
[ ] Touch targets are large enough for mobile use

SECTION 10: DATA ACCURACY
==========================

Test with sample data to verify calculations:

Test Case 1: Single Activity
[ ] Enter: Segment Casting - Target: 10, Achieved: 8
[ ] Verify: Summary shows 1 activity, Target: 10, Achieved: 8, Progress: 80%

Test Case 2: Multiple Activities
[ ] Enter: 3 activities with different values
[ ] Verify: Summary correctly sums all values
[ ] Verify: Progress percentage is correct

Test Case 3: Exceeded Target
[ ] Enter: Target: 10, Achieved: 12
[ ] Verify: Validation error appears
[ ] Verify: Form does not submit

Test Case 4: Zero Values
[ ] Leave all activities at 0 except one
[ ] Verify: Only non-zero activity is saved to database
[ ] Verify: Summary shows correct count (1 activity)

Test Case 5: Decimal Values
[ ] Enter: Concrete Work - Target: 12.5, Achieved: 10.75
[ ] Verify: Values are saved correctly with decimal precision
[ ] Verify: Summary calculations are accurate

SECTION 11: CROSS-BROWSER TESTING
==================================

Test the form on:
[ ] Chrome/Edge (Desktop)
